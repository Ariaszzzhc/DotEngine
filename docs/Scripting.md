# ESM runtime

`Dot.Script.Runtime` owns one QuickJS-NG 0.16.2 realm/context and a FileSystem
copy. Vendor types stay in the implementation unit. The library is a private
pinned vcpkg dependency; its libc/OS modules are not linked into the engine.
The API follows the [official embedding API](https://quickjs-ng.github.io/quickjs/developer-guide/intro/).
TypeScript compilation, engine host bindings, component lifecycles, and hot reload
remain to be implemented; this layer loads and executes real JavaScript ESM.

Create a Runtime with a project FileSystem, load a canonical UTF-8 .js/.mjs entry,
and call an exported function through its scoped ModuleId. Entry paths are root
relative, have no empty/dot/parent components, drive prefixes, backslashes, control
characters, or trailing dot/space components. Paths are limited to 4096 bytes.
Imports must use ./ or ../ with an explicit .js/.mjs extension; normalized paths
must stay inside the root. Filesystem canonical checks also reject symlink escape.
Bare packages, OS modules, import attributes, extension guessing, and bytecode
loading are unsupported. Source is bounded UTF-8 without raw NUL; escaped NUL is
valid string data but forbidden in import specifiers.

A small source patch in the versioned overlay port rejects embedded NUL in both
static and dynamic specifiers before conversion to a C-string alias can load a
different file. The manifest override pins the upstream version and local port
revision; project-wide vcpkg-configuration.json selects the overlay even when a
caller does not use CMake presets. Source/hash/license handling remains in vcpkg.
See [vcpkg configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/reference/vcpkg-configuration-json)
for overlay resolution.

Modules cache per realm, including imports loaded later as entries. Repeated loads
reuse handles/state and same-path file edits do not reload automatically. Cycles,
relative parent imports, live bindings, dynamic imports, and top-level await are
supported. Loader/entry initialization failures fault the realm because resolution
can leave partial module state; a new realm is required for recovery. Stats retain
known compiled-definition/entry records after faults, rather than claiming that
all unresolved native module definitions remain alive.

`call` takes a JSON array with at most 64 arguments and returns an owned optional
JSON string. Argument views are copied into bounded terminated storage before the
SDK reads them. Empty/raw-NUL/bad UTF-8 inputs, invalid names, foreign/stale handles,
non-function exports, oversized JSON, and non-array/too-many arguments fail.
Numbers have normal JavaScript double precision; transport 64-bit entity IDs as
canonical decimal strings. Top-level undefined returns nullopt, while null returns
"null". Other results use JSON serialization/toJSON and enumerable string fields;
undefined/function/symbol/BigInt/nonfinite values, nested promises, enumerable
symbol keys, and cycles fail instead of being silently dropped/substituted.
Nonenumerable fields and prototypes are outside JSON data semantics.

Returned promises must settle using VM jobs. The host marks observed promises
handled, drains bounded jobs, and distinguishes explicit rejection from a promise
with no completing jobs. Unhandled rejections are owned/tracked until handled;
pending promises, infinite job chains, and tracker overflow fault the realm.
The same job counter covers execution and serialization within an operation.
No implicit timers, fetch, require, process, or std/os bindings are installed;
Atomics.wait is disabled. Ordinary clean exceptions are recoverable and include
module/export context and bounded diagnostics/stack when available; earlier script
mutations are not rolled back. Diagnostic getters remain under the execution budget.

Default limits are 16 MiB live VM allocator payload, 128 KiB JS stack, 1 MiB per
source and JSON buffer, 256 modules, 1024 jobs, and 100 ms cooperative execution per
operation. Configurable ranges are: memory 1 byte..1 GiB, stack 64..256 KiB,
source/JSON 1 byte..16 MiB, modules 1..1024, jobs 1..65536, and time 1..1000 ms.
Tiny memory budgets can fail runtime/context initialization and release partial
owners. Runtime payload allocation counters include arenas/backing allocations;
allocator headers, host containers/source copies, and OS internals are excluded.
The custom allocator bounds payload and checks calloc/realloc arithmetic; the
SDK's own quota also applies. Known SDK out-of-memory errors are classified as
faults even when quota rejection occurs before the custom allocator callback.
Caught builtin preflight exceptions can remain ordinary script control flow.
Stack overflow reports an exception; timeout/observed VM allocation/job/loader
failures fault the runtime. This is a cooperative VM bound, not a hostile-code
process sandbox or a filesystem/compilation/destruction real-time guarantee.

All instance operations require the creating thread and reject reentry. Moves
preserve runtime/handle identity; quiescent destruction may happen elsewhere.
Owned JS values, rejection reasons/promises, and namespaces release before the
context/runtime. SDK callbacks contain C++ exceptions rather than unwinding over
the C ABI. Faulted statistics remain queryable; calls/loads require a new realm.
`backendMemory` reports process-wide live allocator payload for lifetime checks.

Run `DotRuntime --script-test <existing-directory>` for an actual file-backed ESM
graph, async JSON calls, shared state, recoverable exceptions, execution interruption,
and complete allocator cleanup. Unit tests also cover malformed inputs, import
paths/attributes/NUL, strict results, memory/job/stack limits, diagnostic getters,
failed initialization, cycles, cache identity, thread/move/foreign destruction,
and lifetime. Only macOS Debug/Release are validated; no sanitizers are used.
